# JavaScript Quiz

## Summary

JavaScript Quiz is deployed and ready to test your knowledge.

### Webpage

* Choosing "Start quiz!" will begin the quiz and start a timer.

* If timer expires (incorrect answers deduct time) quiz stops and jumps to YOU LOSE screen.

* Styling will change dynamically depending on where the user is in the quiz.

* Choosing "View High Scores" will jump to the High Score page.

* High Scores are saved into local storage and will persist upon reloading the webpage.

### Code

* HTML page contains almost no content - it is added/removed dynamically.

* Most of the styling is in the CSS file. Some specific styling is done with JavaScript when conditions are met.

* Wrote Javascript from scratch. The startTimer function was mostly written by Gary.

* All logic pathways to every page of the quiz have been tested and function as intended.

* Descriptive comments added to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
