//   AS A coding boot camp student
// I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
// SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
//   ```

// ## Acceptance Criteria

// ```
// GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
// WHEN I click the start button
// THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
// WHEN I answer a question
// THEN I am presented with another question
// WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
// THEN time is subtracted from the clock
// WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
// THEN the game is over
// WHEN the game is over
// THEN I can save my initials and my score

// HOMEWORK TIPS

//
// 1. Be thinking about how an array of objects might be very useful here
// 2. Use functions to control the overflow flow of things
// 3. No questions/answers in the HTML
// 4. How can we generate each new question and its answers on demand
// 5. How can we keep track of which question is on-screen
// 6. Get the quiz to work with 1-2 questions
// 7. Make the timer value very high to begin with
// 8. Console.log whatever you need for testing
//
